Rodov Reactor is a visualized data bank.
It contains gender based statistics for Republic of Macedonia in every aspect and from many sources.
It was the initial though behind the project.

Of course, it can be used as a data bank for everything.

Rodov Reactor uses:

Highcharts: http://www.highcharts.com/ - for the visuelization of data
Haystack: http://haystacksearch.org/ - specifically whoosh module for search

Highcharts can generate graphs directly from a database, but we had many numbers that were spread out,
and we were searching them manually in the different publications, so we decided to create separate files with the data,
grouped by the same name for the different representation and create them one by one.

Reactor is consisted of senior and junior researchers + IT team, and this was also the only way the junior researchers 
can make their own graphs and just upload them trouhg the admin panel.

This is just version 1.0.

A very different team of very different people was working on this, so it has space for much improvement.

Version 2.0 should contain:

1. Better and easier graph creation and upload;
2. Better division and navigation;
